# Brief Description
Pong is a classic arcade game where two players control paddles on opposite sides of the screen. The goal is to hit the ball with the paddles, trying to make the ball pass the opponent's paddle. Each time the ball passes a paddle, the opposing player earns a point. The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined score or until the players decide to end the game.
